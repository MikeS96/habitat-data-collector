## 📦 Environment Setup

> 🖥️ This setup is tested on **Ubuntu 22.04** with **Python 3.10**.

### 1. Clone the repository with submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MikeS96/habitat-data-collector.git
cd habitat-data-collector
```

### 2. Create the Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate habitat_data_collector
```

### 3. Build and install Habitat Sim & Lab

> This step will take some time as it compiles Habitat-Sim from source.
> Habitat cannot be installed by conda in Python 3.10, so it must be built manually.

```bash
bash scripts/install_habitat.sh
```

> During compiling with habitat-sim, if having error with OgenGL, like `Could NOT find OpenGL` and errors with compiling `zlib_external`, install the required libs by:
>```bash
> sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev zlib1g-dev
>```


## 📦 Dataset Setup

Before running the tool, please follow the [dataset setup guide](documents/dataset/dataset.md) to prepare the required datasets.


## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

For a detailed explanation of configuration options and structure, please refer to the [Configuration Reference](documents/config_reference/config_reference.md). Setting up correct configs is crucial for running this tool.


## 🚀 Run the Collector

Run the main simulation from the root directory:

```bash
python -m habitat_data_collector.main
```

By default, it uses the configuration file at: `config/habitat_data_collector.yaml`. For config details, refer to the [Config Reference](documents/config_reference/config_reference.md).

### ROS2 Integration (Optional)

If you want to receive and send ROS2 topic outputs or record ROS2 bags:

1. Install **ROS2 Humble** following the [official guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).
2. Source the ROS2 environment before running the collector:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  # or setup.zsh
```

Once sourced, the simulator will publish data to ROS2 topics. You can record them by enabling the ROS recording configuration in `config/habitat_data_collector.yaml`. See the [ROS Integration Documentation](documents/ros.md) for topic configuration and ROS2-to-ROS1 bridge setup.


## 📘 User Guide

**Once the simulator launches successfully, refer to the [Usage Guide](documents/usage/usage.md) to learn how to**:

- Move the camera and explore the scene
- Add, place, grab, and delete objects
- Start and stop recording (raw data + ROS2 bag)
- Save and reload a scene configuration

The guide includes visual previews and terminal output samples for better understanding.

## ⚠️ Notes

- ROS2 Humble must be installed and sourced before using ROS features.
- Configurations are handled with [OmegaConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/) and [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).
- All paths, topics, and behaviors are configured in `config/habitat_data_collector.yaml`.
